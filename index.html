                <p>
                    <b>Jawaharlal Nehru, (born Nov. 14, 1889, Allahabad, India—died May 27, 1964, New Delhi), First
                        prime minister of
                        independent India (1947–64). Son of the independence advocate Motilal Nehru (1861–1931), Nehru
                        was educated at home and
                        in Britain and became a lawyer in 1912. More interested in politics than law, he was impressed
                        by Mohandas K. Gandhi’s
                        approach to Indian independence. His close association with the Indian National Congress began
                        in 1919; in 1929 he
                        became its president, presiding over the historic Lahore session that proclaimed complete
                        independence (rather than
                        dominion status) as India’s political goal. He was imprisoned nine times between 1921 and 1945
                        for his political
                        activity. When India was granted limited self-government in 1935, the Congress Party under Nehru
                        refused to form
                        coalition governments with the Muslim League in some provinces; the hardening of relations
                        between Hindus and Muslims
                        that followed ultimately led to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan. Shortly
                        before Gandhi’s
                        assassination in 1948, Nehru became the first prime minister of independent India. He attempted
                        a foreign policy of
                        nonalignment during the Cold War, drawing harsh criticism if he appeared to favour either camp.
                        During his tenure, India
                        clashed with Pakistan over the Kashmir region and with China over the Brahmaputra River valley.
                        He wrested Goa from the
                        Portuguese. Domestically, he promoted democracy, socialism, secularism, and unity, adapting
                        modern values to Indian
                        conditions. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, became prime minister two years after his death.

                <h3>Contribution in Freedom Struggle</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Though Nehru wasn’t exactly convinced with the functioning of the Indian National Congress,
                        which was dominated by the English-knowing upper class elite, yet he participated in the civil
                        rights campaign initiated by Gandhi.</li>
                    <li>Nehru argued for self-government and status of a Dominion within the British Empire as enjoyed
                        by Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland.</li>
                    <li>During the World War II, Nehru demanded for assurance of full independence for India after the
                        war and inclusion of Indians in the central government to share power and responsibility, but
                        the British did not oblige. He, along with Gandhi, manifested a limited civil disobedience and
                        was jailed for the same.</li>
                    <li>Nehru appealed for complete national independence which was initially objected to by Gandhi who
                        proposed a dominion status for India in a time frame of two years. Following the rejection of
                        Gandhi’s plea and Nehru’s presidency over the Lahore session of Congress in 1928, Nehru demanded
                        for complete independence. This resolution made him one of the most significant leaders of the
                        independence movement.</li> <br><br>
                </ul>
                <h3>Awards & Achievements</h3>
                <p> Nehru was bestowed with the Barat Ratna award in 1955, India’s highest civilian honor for his
                    outstanding contribution during the freedom struggle and as the first Prime Minister of India.</p>
                <br><br>
